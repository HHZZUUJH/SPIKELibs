# SPIKELibs
This is the repository for my LEGO SPIKE Prime and Robot Inventor libraries.

The easiest way to use it is to copy the content from PUPSensorLib.py into a new python project in the SPIKE Prime or Mindstorms Robot Inventor software. Then you can paste the code of the example you'd like to use below that into the project.
Another option is to upload the code to the hub and use it as a library. Check https://github.com/XenseEducation/spiketools-release/releases for a tool to do that.
